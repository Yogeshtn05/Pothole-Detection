# Pothole Detection System | KPIT Sparkle Semi Final

In this project we developed an AI model to detect potholes from the input of depth cameras placed on vehicles. The model is built using 2500 images of pothole images collected from various sources. The model has an accuracy of 81.2%. The model is built using YOLOV8N

We used this model to built an application to be run on Edge devices like Raspberry Pi 4 and NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. The application will alert the driver and also mark the GPS co-ordinates of the Potholes in a website we created which will alert the driver in future about the potholes ahead

From this project we learnt
- Collecting images and building a model
- Developing an application using the model
- Deploying the model in Edge devices
